# kangrouter-py
Python client for [KangRouter](https://thesolvingmachine.com/kangrouter/) - pickup/delivery transportation services optimization. 
    
## Installation

```bash
pip install kangrouter-py
```

## Usage

### Preliminaries
For interacting with the API, both an *apiKey* and a *licenseId* are required. Please
obtain them from your [account](https://thesolvingmachine.com/account) page.

### An example problem

Input problems are described as a python dict. As a (simplistic) example, consider the problem of:
* Taking [Alberto Caeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pessoa#Alberto_Caeiro) home after a medical appointment at the [Garcia de Orta Hospital](http://www.hgo.pt/). He is ready to leave the hospital after 13:00, and must be home no later than 14:15. Alberto is on a wheelchair, so we allocate 5 minutes for pickup and dropoff.
* Picking [Ricardo Reis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pessoa#Ricardo_Reis) at the [Brasileira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_A_Brasileira) caf√©, and take him to a beach restaurant. He wants to be there no later than 12:15. Ricardo takes a regular seat.

Assume that the vehicle available for transportation is parked in [Sintra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintra), has 3 seats and room for 2 wheelchairs.  Additionally, the driver must have a 60 minute lunch break between 12:00 and 14:00. 

This problem translates to the following object:

```python
problem = {
  "nbResources": 2,
  "jobs": [
    {
      "jobId": "Pickup Alberto at the hospital",
      "origLat": "38.674921",
      "origLon": "-9.175401",
      "destLat": "38.716860",
      "destLon": "-9.162417",
      "minStartTime": "13:00",
      "maxEndTime": "14:15",
      "pickupDuration": 5,
      "deliveryDuration": 5,
      "consumptions": [0,1]
    },
    {
      "jobId": "Take Ricardo to the beach",
      "origLat": "38.710835",
      "origLon": "-9.142143",
      "destLat": "38.634080",
      "destLon": "-9.230549",
      "maxEndTime": "12:15",
      "pickupDuration": 1,
      "deliveryDuration": 1,
      "consumptions": [1,0]
    }
  ],
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "vehicleId": "12-AS-46",
      "depotLat": "38.806842",
      "depotLon": "-9.382556",
      "minStartTime": "07:00",
      "maxEndTime": "22:00",
      "maxWorkDuration": 540,
      "capacities": [2,3],
      "breaks": [
        {
          "breakId": "Lunch",
          "minStartTime": "12:00",
          "maxEndTime": "14:00",
          "duration": 60
        }
      ],
      "overspeed": 1.25
    }
  ]
}
```
Interesting problems have multiple jobs and multiple vehicles, but the example above should be enough to get you going.

### Submit a problem

The code below creates a new solver for the provided example:

```python
from kangrouter import KangRouterClient
api = KangRouterClient(apiKey,licenseId)
solverId = api.create(problem)
```

### Check solving status

After a solver is created it can be in one of 4 states:
* pending - The solver is queued for execution but not started yet.
* solving - The solver is executing.
* completed - The solver has finished.
* invalid - The problem is invalid, or an unexpected error has occurred.

The function below is used to query the solver current state and obtain information regarding the solving progress:

```python
status = api.getStatus(solverId)
print(status)
```

This is a very simple problem, so the solver executes very quickly:


```python
{
  "execStatus": "completed",
  "nbJobsDiscarded": 0,
  "solverEndTime": "Wed Nov 18 11:59:48 2015 GMT",
  "solverStartTime": "Wed Nov 18 11:59:40 2015 GMT",
  "totalDistance": 98,
}
```

Given that larger problems may take a few minutes, calling this function while the solver is executing will also return ETA (expected delivery time) for completion.

### Get the solution

When the solver is done, the solution may be retrieved as follows:

```python
solution = api.getSolution(solverId)
print(solution)
```

The solution shows at what times, or time intervals, drivers must leave their depots, start their work breaks, or perform pickup/delivery actions:

```python
{
  "jobsScheduled": [
    {
      "jobId": "Pickup Alberto at the hospital",
      "maxEndTime": "14:15",
      "maxStartTime": "13:55",
      "minEndTime": "13:20",
      "minStartTime": "13:00",
      "vehicleId": "12-AS-46"
    },
    {
      "jobId": "Take Ricardo to the beach",
      "maxEndTime": "12:15",
      "maxStartTime": "11:59",
      "minEndTime": "11:14",
      "minStartTime": "10:58",
      "vehicleId": "12-AS-46"
    }
  ],
  "type": "total",
  "vehiclesScheduled": [
    {
      "breaks": [
        {
          "breakId": "Lunch",
          "maxEndTime": "13:55",
          "maxStartTime": "12:55",
          "minEndTime": "13:00",
          "minStartTime": "12:00"
        }
      ],
      "maxEndTime": "14:35",
      "maxStartTime": "11:38",
      "minEndTime": "13:40",
      "minStartTime": "10:37",
      "vehicleId": "12-AS-46"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Other methods
The remaining methods allow to stop a running solver, which might be useful if you're in a hurry:

```python
api.stop(solverId)
```

and remove a solver (and associated data) from the server:

```python
api.delete(solverId)
```
